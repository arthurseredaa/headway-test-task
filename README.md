# Headway test task

I completed this project for selection to the Headway :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn predeploy`

If you change code base, you need to run predeploy command, that allow you to see your changes in deployed app on github-pages.

### `yarn deploy`
After you make predeploy, you need to completely deploy app on github-pages, so run this command.

## Cheers ;)
